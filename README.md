# ðŸ“º mpv / iiNA Scripts
Some scripts to make life easier when using mpv and iina (mpv fork for OSX) 

## 1. [ðŸ’¬ autosub.lua](https://github.com/myQwil/mpv-iina-scripts/blob/master/autosub.lua)
### True automatic subtitle downloading for mpv, works on OSX and Linux
This is a Improved fork of the [autosub](https://gist.github.com/selsta/ce3fb37e775dbd15c698) script by **selsta**. It Automatically downloads subtitles if they are not present using **subliminal**

**Make sure you have [subliminal](https://github.com/Diaoul/subliminal) installed**

****Usage:****

1. Download **autosub.lua**
2. Copy to **~/.config/mpv/scripts/**
3. Open a video file using mpv, the subtitles will automatically get downloaded

> this is simply a lazy hack to make the script work the way its meant to be, all credits should go to the original author: [**selsta**](https://gist.github.com/selsta/ce3fb37e775dbd15c698).Absolutely no programming skills were involved in modifying this script.enjoy :)
